Chapters: 

1. Introduction : 
    1. What is Javascript or JS ?
    2. What are the applications of Javascript ?
    3. Where does Javascript code run ?
    4. what is ECMA script and What is the difference between Javascript and ECMA script ?
    One more question comes to most of them who enter into development; which is "Is Javascript connected to Java ? or something similar."
